# Zigterpreter (0.0.26)
Making a monkey lang interpreter in zig
From the book Writing an interpreter in go [https://interpreterbook.com/]

### 
The author Thorsten Ball is smart, I reccomend buying the book to support his work
Working on chapter 2 currently

### 
If you have any code reccomendations based on what you see, please let me know as I am simply learning Zig (not an expert)
Would love recomendations specifically on the Zig code specifically not so much the implementation of the interpreter if that makes sense
